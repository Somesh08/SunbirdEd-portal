                                <p>The biggest asset of any business is its employees. Successful organizations are aware of this, and they know how important it is to invest in talent. Many studies show that companies that have dedicated employee training
                                    and development programs see not only a sharp increase in profits but also have a high level of staff retention, which is vital for sustained business growth. Employee training is worth the investment because replacing
                                    talents is far more expensive than retaining existing ones. According to a study conducted by Gallup, replacements can cost a company around 150 percent of a staff's annual salary. </p>

                                <p>Learning as a discipline has evolved over centuries. One of the great mediums has been learning by hearing or “Shruti” for passing on the wisdom of our ancient scriptures across generations. However, with time this process
